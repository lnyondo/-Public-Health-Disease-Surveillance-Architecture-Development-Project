# Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project
🏥Developed by Lusubilo Nyondo| MSc in Health Informatics| Michigan Technological University

## Project Overview:
This project focused on developing a simulated public health disease surveillance architecture using virtual machines to represent hospitals and a central health information exchange (HIE). By integrating OpenEMR, HAPI-FHIR, Synthea, and Google Looker Studio, the system demonstrates how health data can be securely captured, exchanged, and visualized to support real-time public health decision-making

## Project Ojectives and Activities
* 🖥️ Develop 5 Virtual Machines (4 hospitals and 1 HIE); VM's are a safe testing environment in network architecture and development  
* 💻 Install and Configure OpenEMR into the hospital machines  
* 🔐 Secure the EMR application instance in the machines  
* 🦠 Generate COVID 19 patients using Synthea within the hospital geographical locations to simulate disease outbreak  
* 🌐 Successfully install and configure HAPI-FHIR; understand its concept and implementation processes and troubleshoot related issues using commands  
* 📊 Analyse and intepret data received through HAPI-FHIR to identify public health priorities such as disease trends to make informed decisions for public health interventions  
* 🔄 Understand the role of HAPI-FHIR in exchanging HL7 FHIR messages from EHR for critical public health surveilance  
* 📈 Visualize the extracted data in Google Looker studio 

## Technologies Used
1. Ubuntu Linux in VMalware Workstation
2. OpenEMR
3. HAPI-FHIR
4. HL7 FHIR (Postman)
5. SYNTHEA
6. Python| Pandas
7. Google Looker Studio

## Challenges Faced during the Project
*  Connectivity and network configuration issues across the machines
*  Data transformation for visualization
*  Integration barriers; all technologies need specific learning curves
*  Reccurring issues with synthea generated data
