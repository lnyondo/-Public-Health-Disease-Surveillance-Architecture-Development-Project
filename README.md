# -Public-Health-Disease-Surveillance-Architecture-Development-Project
Developed by Lusubilo Nyondo| MSc in Health Informatics| Michigan Technological University
# Project Ojectives and Activities
Develop 5 Virtual Machines (4 hospitals and 1 HIE); VM's are a safe testing environment in network architecture and development
Install and Configure OpenEMR into the hospital machines 
Secure the EMR application instance in the machines
Generate COVID 19 patients using Synthea within the hospital geographical locations to simulate disease outbreak
Successfully install and configure HAPI-FHIR; understand its concept and implementation processes and troubleshoot related issues using commands
Analyse and intepret data received through HAPI-FHIR to identify public health priorities such as disease trends to make informed decisions for public health interventions
Understand the role of HAPI-FHIR in exchanging HL7 FHIR messages from EHR for critical public health surveilance
Visualize the extracted data in Google Looker studio 

# Technologies Used
Ubuntu Linux in VMalware Workstation
OpenEMR
HAPI-FHIR
HL7 FHIR (Postman)
SYNTHEA
Python| Pandas
Google Looker Studio

# Challenges Faced during the Project
Connectivity and network configuration issues across the machines
Data transformation for visualization
Integration barriers; all technologies need specific learning curves
Reccurring issues with synthea generated data

# Personal Contribution
System design, architectural planning and initiation; set up and manage VM environments
Connectivity and network troubleshooting
HAPI-FHIR, Synthea, HL7(Postman) configuration and deployment
Custom data transformation and scripting
Data export and visualization
